Firefly v2
==========

The goal of the Firefly project is to showcase AIOLOS connecting IoT gateways to the cloud and end-user devices.

This is v2 of the Firefly project, based on the OSGi enRoute project, in order to exploit all the OSGi enRoute goodies. The aim also is to have a more modular implementation of the UI, rule system, etc.
